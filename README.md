# praat-stuff
This repository contains scripts that we have been used with Praat, with some explanations about how they are currently used. Usually they connect to more complex workflows around ELAN, R and other tools. The workflows are partially described in lecture series [Advanced analysis and manipulation of ELAN corpus data with R and Python](https://langdoc.github.io/elan_lectures/).

The scripts are based into examples of [Steven Buss's formant script](https://github.com/sbuss/get-formants-for-vowels) and [Will Styler's COG script](https://github.com/stylerw/styler_praat_scripts/blob/master/peak_spectral_COG.praat). Attribution is added also to the scripts themselves.
