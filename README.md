# praat-stuff
This repository contains scripts that we have been used with Praat, with some explanations about how they are currently used. Usually they connect to more complex workflows around ELAN, R and other tools.

There is no guarantee that these scripts would be generally useful, as they are very heavily tied to our ELAN infrastructure.

**At the moment I don't credit correctly my sources, on whose work those scripts are probably up to 99%. Apologies! This will be fixed soon! Please send angry email to nikotapiopartanen@gmail.com.**
